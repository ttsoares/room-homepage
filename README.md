## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Hotkeys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys-hook) - A React hook for using keyboard shortcuts in components in a declarative way.
- [TW-Animated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-animated) - Extended animation utilities for Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

- Had to build the burger menu from scratch as this one is horizontal...
- Learned to use the React libs to handle keyboard and animations.

### Continued development

Still have been ding to much try_and_error to build the CSS infrastructure with Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- The icons SVG usually included in the challenges do not follow the text color defined in the container where they are. I'v been using the ones there:
  [TW Icons](https://heroicons.com/) - Icons more Tailwind friendly.

- Also, the <Image/> tag from NextJS, when used with SVGs, pose some difficulties...
